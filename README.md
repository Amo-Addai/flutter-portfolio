<!-- (https://www.auto-mobile-portfolio.AUTO.com) -->


Explore my GitHub Mono-Repo Hub of innovation with diverse mobile app projects in Flutter, Pure Native (Android, iOS, Windows Phone), and Web Mobile (Ionic, NativeScript, ) specifically. 

UI styles like Material, Argon, and more blend seamlessly with Flutter & Pure Native/Web Mobile frameworks. 

It will be a playground for dynamic tech stack combinations, in Mobile app frameworks only (Ongoing project, as my public code will be released in timely intervals). 


Reach out to me to gain access to my private Flutter  & Pure Native/Web Mobile Repositories.
